Due to the nature of this library, travis tests cannot be conducted as that would expose my API key. In order to run the tests you need to:

 1. [Create a Dropbox app](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create) **with full Dropbox access**
 2. Generate an access token - at the time of writing these do not expire.
 3. Create a file called **API_KEY** in the project's root directory
